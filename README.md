Introduction
------------

This project implements a source code indexer in C++-17 using Clang and
minimal 3rd party dependencies.


Scope
-----

The source code indexer will support the following types of queries:

   * location of symbol declaration

   * location of symbol definition

   * locations of symbol references

   * identify symbol at specific location

   * list of base classes for symbol, if applicable

   * list of derived classes for symbol, if applicable

   * list of override functions or methods for symbol, if applicable

As stretch goal, it will implement Language Server Protocol.


Dependencies
------------

Dependencies imported from the OS image (referenced, not included)

Building
--------

    git clone ...
    mkdir ftags.build
    cd ftags.build
    [CXX=clang++-7] cmake ../ftags -DLIBCLANG_LLVM_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=llvm-config-7 [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug]
    cmake --build .

Note: don't use -GNinja if you plan to work on this project because due to
[CMake Bug  17450](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17450) the
compile\_commands.json contains invalid relative paths to the generated files
instead of absolute paths. So your code completion engine will not find some
of the protobuf-generated files.
