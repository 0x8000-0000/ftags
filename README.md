Introduction
------------

This project implements a source code indexer in C++-17 using Clang and
minimal 3rd party dependencies.


Scope
-----

The source code indexer will support the following types of queries:

   * location of symbol declaration

   * location of symbol definition

   * locations of symbol references

   * identify symbol at specific location

   * list of base classes for symbol, if applicable

   * list of derived classes for symbol, if applicable

   * list of override functions or methods for symbol, if applicable

As stretch goal, it will implement Language Server Protocol.


Dependencies
------------

Dependencies imported from the OS image (referenced, not included)

   * [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

   * [Ã˜MQ](http://zeromq.org/)

To install the prerequisites on Debian run the following command:

    sudo apt install libzmq3-dev libbenchmark-dev \
        libbenchmark-tools libclang-7-dev libclang1-7 clang-7 \
        libprotobuf-dev protobuf-c-compiler

On Ubuntu 18.04, the protobuf version included is too old. Please install
version v3.7.1 from [source](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

Included dependencies:

   * [Clara](https://github.com/catchorg/Clara)
   * [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
   * [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
   * [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
   * [PEGTL](https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL)


Building
--------

    git clone ...
    mkdir ftags.build
    cd ftags.build
    [CXX=clang++-7] cmake ../ftags -DLIBCLANG_LLVM_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=llvm-config-7 [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug]
    cmake --build .

Note: don't use -GNinja if you plan to work on this project because due to
[CMake Bug  17450](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17450) the
compile\_commands.json contains invalid relative paths to the generated files
instead of absolute paths. So your code completion engine will not find some
of the protobuf-generated files.


Running
-------

At this stage, the service components need to be started manually:

* src/worker/ft\_logger
* src/server/ft\_server
* src/worker/ft\_indexer # you may launch several instances
* src/worker/ft\_scanner -p tags .
* src/client/ft\_client --all --symbol main      # to test
